Vision
In contrast to the physical world, only one degree of separation lies between everyone on the internet. This heightened connectivity allows for new models of coordination + creation that are native to the digital realm. Public Assembly will test the current best practices for leveraging the unique physics of the internet to create what’s missing as fast as possible.

Focus
From a public standpoint, the main goal of Public Assembly will be to create as many high-impact, need-filling prototypes as possible. Prototypes can range from small components of larger ideas to fully specified applications, as well as subDAO spinoffs based on prototypes that are ready to be the focus of a continuous development cycle. Of course, other types of ideas will be funded as well (for example, governance/ecosystem-related initiatives, bounty programs, and so on).
The DAO's background/underlying focus (or “destination”) will be determining how to maximize decentralized, asynchronous, internet-based coordination in pursuit of building digital infrastructure.

Governance Overview
Nouns Model + Ecosystem
We posit that the nouns model is the best way to help build open-source, non-extractive digital infrastructure right now. By using this model as the basis for the Public Assembly DAO, we can start working at scale as soon as the onchain entity is put into place. By choosing this model, we can also build on existing public infrastructure (like noun.market, prop.house, nouns.wtf, etc.) that helps manage decentralized

Nouns Implementation
The Nouns model will be implemented in a manner similar to that of the NounsDAO although there will be some differences in the proposal threshold percentage and the founder allocations.

In order to encourage more people to participate in governance, the proposal threshold will be lowered from its current value of 0.25% to 0.1%. At the moment, approximately 80% of Nouns holders are unable to submit proposals because the threshold is set at 0.25%.
There will be a significant difference in the founder allocation:
9% to ZORA as a token of appreciation for the initial funding and energy behind this initiative.
4% divided among four Public Assembly founders who are not ZORA members (Javier, Neesh, Salief, Val)
1% share each for ZORA founding members (Dain, Max, Joey)
1% will go to the Builder DAO because it was responsible for developing the Nouns Builder infrastructure.

Public Assembly will be aggressive in airdropping direct governance of the treasury to individuals and communities that we want to empower and align ourselves with. This is not a coded part of the allocation; however, it is something we will do

Proposals
Onchain proposals directly resulting in the funding of project sprints, DAO wide initiatives, or unique opportunities will be a key factor in the ability for Public Assembly to fill as many needs in the ecosystem as possible. Initial ideas for the types of proposals we want to see funded include:
High-impact product sprints involving trusted members of the community
Bounty programs aimed around proliferating prototypes developed during product sprints + lowering the barrier to entry for public involvement in the development cycle of the DAO

DAO spinoffs (also following nouns model) that fund teams focused on carrying forward the most impactful prototypes / models into their own DAO — which would kick back % of their founding allocations to Public Assembly
Unique one-off / ecosystem wide initiatives

Governance/structural adjustments
Prop House
The “Prop House” has become a defining piece of the NounsDAO ecosystem since its inception in this proposal. The stated goal of the Prop House is to minimize friction in deploying as much capital to qualified projects as possible. 
This is accomplished via forced treasury spend (top X proposals submitted to Prop House rounds WILL be funded, regardless of proposal quality), and the ability for ANYONE (not just Public Assembly holders) to submit proposals to Prop House rounds. The types of rounds we envision getting funded in the Prop House are:
Product sprints around a general concept/missing piece of infrastructure where the end product is not clear enough to warrant a full proposal — so multiple teams/solutions getting funded is desirable. These prototypes could then be the subject of enhancement via standalone proposals, or immediately spun off into subDAOs for further development

Roadmap

Short Term
Development of governance vision + implementation strategy + branding
Full product sprint + bounty program betas carried out pre-DAO (aka not funded by an onchain DAO proposal), that will be extensively documented and presented publicly so as to garner community interest + provide inspiration / best practices for anyone who wants to participate in the Public Assembly
Deployment of the DAO via Nouns Builder
Airdrop of Public Assembly NFTs to initial product sprint public contributors (the non Zora Labs members)

Medium Term
Nouns Builder Goerli run-through and auditing 
DAO design / parameters
Artwork for governance token
Revision of Public Assembly values 
public- - -assembly.com website update
Sprint #2
Education: How to DAO / How to Curate
Promotion

Random Thoughts 
Core Funding Models Could Be:
funded by prop house: targeted prompts asking for solution, not providing specific direction
multiple projects can respond in prop house
funded by prop house: targeted prompts asking for pieces of a solution to a specific use case
RFP for teams to respond to specific pieces of the proposal, we’ll pick the best one for each of the specific pieces. once these are built, they can be combined together for a focused product sprint via full proposal
funded by proposals: targeted sprints to develop speccd prototypes or initiatives
funded by proposals: subDAO spinoffs
