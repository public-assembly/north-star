***What***
1. What is Public Assembly?

Public Assembly is an organization of builders gathered together to create what's missing. _Who are builders?_ Builders are educators, designers, engineers, organizers, activists, those without titles, those with many titles, individuals who engage with the Internet as a substrate to be added upon. _What does it mean to create what's missing?_ What is "missing" is up to you and your squad to decide. We exist to hack, remix, and document.

3. What is Public Assembly's relationship to Zora?

Public Assembly exists in Zora's orbit. Our core contributors are a mixture of independent builders and Zora Labs team members. 10% of ownership of the DAO that surrounds Public Assembly is held by a multisig Zora Labs controls.

4. What does Public Assembly aim to achieve?

— to be determined —

What is #ff89de and what is our relationship to Public Assembly?

#ff89de is comprised of seven contributors. These individuals came together to conceptualize and develop the foundational elements of Public Assembly. Much of the influence of #ff89de is reflected via Public Assembly’s auction mechanics, website, and throughout Neosound. That being said, in the eyes of #ff89de, Public Assembly is much larger than what seven contributors alone can accomplish. We hope to set squads and contributors alike on a path of carving their own space within Public Assembly, utilizing the resources it provides and leaning on (when necessary) the guidelines #ff89de has provided.

What does #ff89de aim to achieve?

Much of what is to come in the future of Public Assembly is uncertain. However, in the immediate term, we’re committed to continuing to provide accessible documentation of our work. Alongside, contextual and highly specific educational content in the form of videos, collaborative experiences, and various writing. Everything we do should be replicable, not in the hopes that others follow us, but with the hope that we’ve provided sufficient context that will allow others to create what’s missing.

### What
#### 1. What is PA

Public Assembly to me is where very talented creators meet to build “the thing” in public. Those things are high-impact, need-filling builds that could be what "the builder" needed in their individual journey, that they felt was missing all along. Those builds could even be an extension of something else but reoptimized. By building the thing and open sourcing it: we educate, get curators and researchers the funding they need onchain, and create modular repositories/marketplaces for anyone to use as a resource. I think a strong philosophy is dropping seeds for the next person to pick up and async communication. In this we actually facilitate a path to the community continuing product development and understanding how. 

This is done by elevating subDAO spinoffs funded by proposals on the community reserve. We also elevated the research needed to know the best ways to do this. It is really a social experiment in exploring new avenues of how to work together and always pass it forward.

#### 2. What is Public Assembly's relationship to Zora?

Zora has all these great products and Public Assembly packages them into abstracted tools and gets them to the hands of the people quickly. Providing human perspective and accelerated learning style hands on tools and content for people to get it in an digestible fashion. Public assembly is dedicated to the manifestation of more creativity but we are also in alignment with the ethos of building hyperstructures as protocols.

#### 3. What does Public Assembly Aim to Achieve 

Optimized working groups where people find where they fit and grow. Cross collaboration of internet builders. I see PA with way more lives touched than my own, more Web 3 hybrids of artists being developers, fun and sleek dApps that people of any expertise level can use. I personally would like to see the first Public Assembly studio space and IRL events where education can happen in a warmer environment.

### Why
#### 1. Why is Public Assembly important?
We have so many brilliant people and qualified builders in the space who don't have the resources to publish their hard work or pass it forward when it's truly valuable information. This creates a chasm for new creators and fresh ideas entering the space and blocks propelling web 3.0 forward. 

We also have many organizatons without a model to quickly bring in more contributors that end up reverting back to the model that they ran from in the first place. 

It's a public good. Acommunity owned pool used for internet infrastructure for public education and curation helps solve one of the issues with open source models.

People can also define what they want to see. It’s a fraction of ownership to redistributing value in a larger pool to accerlerate the optimization of more products. 

### How
#### 1. How is Public Assembly structured?

Similar to the orbit model of contributions

We want to create multiple orbits that coexist together and cross collaborate.

#### 2. How will Public Assembly measure success?

How many subDaos are building full scale prototypes. How much cross collaboration is happening within those groups.
