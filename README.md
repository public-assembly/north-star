## PA in 100 Words
Public Assembly simplifies design problems to expedite curiosity. We value iterative processes and embrace intuitive solutions. By identifying incongruities around us, we attract motivated individuals and equip them with the resources to create what's missing. We emphasize education, promote interdependence, and celebrate firsts to maintain an accessible environment that increases the probability of participation. Prioritizing core values over transient opportunities establishes a circle of trust where growth occurs naturally and ideas pass freely between collaborators.
