## PA in 100 Words
Public Assembly simplifies design problems to expedite curiosity. We listen to our intuition and embrace simple solutions that are commonly overlooked for more complex explanations. By proactively searching for incongruities around us, we identify what’s missing and aim to connect the dots through intentional documentation and a willingness to iterate. When supplemented with robust education and a team—centric approach, “the most important questions” can be explored with excitement in an accessible environment that welcomes mistakes. Prioritizing core values over transient opportunities establishes a circle of trust where growth occurs naturally and ideas pass freely between collaborators.

TBD (this is where we can get more into the details of coding, design, daos, crypto, internet, async coord, orbital structure, etc.)

## What is Public Assembly's relationship to Zora?
PA will rely on nouns style governance to facilitate collective management of a shared onchain treasury. ZORA will hold 10% of the governance power. 3/7 members in the Public Assembly [founding team](https://twitter.com/FF89DE) are full time employees at [ZORA](https://twitter.com/ourZORA).

## What is #FF89DE and what is our relationship to Public Assembly

#FF89DE is comprised of seven contributors. These individuals came together to conceptualize and develop the foundational elements of Public Assembly. Much of the influence of #ff89de is reflected via Public Assembly’s auction mechanics, website, and throughout Neosound. That being said, in the eyes of #ff89de, Public Assembly is much larger than what seven contributors alone can accomplish. We hope to set squads and contributors alike on a path of carving their own space within Public Assembly, utilizing the resources it provides and leaning on (when necessary) the guidelines #ff89de has provided.
